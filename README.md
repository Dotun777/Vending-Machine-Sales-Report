# Vending-Machine-Sales-Report
This report analyses sales data from vending machines across diverse locations in Central New Jersey, encompassing a library, a mall, an office setting and a manufacturing facility. The dataset is valuable for analysing consumer behaviour and vending machine performance in various environments. The locations and machine data are as follows:
1.	Gutten Plans: A frozen dough specialist company that operates 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. Vending machine: GuttenPlans x1367.
2.	EB Public Library: A public library boasting high foot traffic over 5 - 6 days a week. Vending machine: EB Public Library x1380.
3.	Brunswick Sq Mall: This mall experiences average foot traffic over all 7 days of the week. Vending machine(s): BSQ Mall x1364 - Zales and BSQ Mall x1366 - ATT.
4.	Earle Asphalt: A construction engineering firm in operation 5 days a week.

By exploring this data, I aim to uncover insights into purchasing trends, product popularity, and potential opportunities for optimization within each location.
